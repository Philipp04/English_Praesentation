# slides

This is a template for projects with presentations or slides. It is strongly encouraged to use it as such (but you can of course go old school and do a fork)

It is as of yet empty - there are only a few "this page intentionally left blank" slides to get you started.

It uses [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) as foundation - if you have questions about how to do something - please see there...

The presentation skeleton is done in a way thet you only have to write markdown to fill it: You have to edit [slides.md](slides.md) to do so. But it is of course possible to unleash the full power of
[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) by editing [index.html](index.html).

Whenever you commit changes to the project, it is rebuilt via a Ci/CD pipeline so that the live version (uses pages functionality) is always up to date.

You will - regardless wether you forked or used the template - have to edit the link to the live presentation here:
